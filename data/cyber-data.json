    "description": "Imagine if a company could analyze sensitive information, such as hospital records and bank transactions, without ever viewing the information. This is exactly what we can do with homomorphic encryption; it's like having a magic calculator that can do math over locked numbers.\n\nProject Description\n\nIn this project, you will create a platform that allows a user to upload some encrypted data to it. The server then does some computations on the data – without decrypting – and provides a result back the user, if attackers breach the server they will only see information that is nonsensical.\n\nHow do we accomplish this?",

    "description": "At this moment, data is incredibly valuable—however, most organizations do not want to share their data. But what if an organization could train an AI model together without sharing privately identifiable data? That's where Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) comes in. MPC technology allows various organizations work together without revealing their private data.\n\nProject Description\n\nIn this project, you will create a simulation of how companies can cooperate safely. You will build a small scale system that has multiple datasets (one dataset from a bank, or a hospital, etc.) being used to train one AI model where each dataset is kept private, but they all work toward the same goal. This gives you an insight into how privacy-preserving machine learning is performed settings where sensitive data is involved.\n\nHow do we accomplish it?\n\n    Pick an AI model (for example, predicting credit risk).\n    Split the training on several participants.\n    Utilize an MPC library to protect computations.\n    Combine results to generate one global AI model.\n\nTech Stack\n\nProgramming languages: Python, Rust\n\nLibraries: MP-SPDZ, TensorFlow Federated\n\nTools: gRPC (for data exchange), Docker\n\nImplications\n\nThis technology is being used in sensitive applications, such as banking or healthcare, where privacy is more important than speed.
