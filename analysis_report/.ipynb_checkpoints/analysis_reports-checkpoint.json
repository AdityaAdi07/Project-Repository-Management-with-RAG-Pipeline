Instead, focus on unique aspects of your project that set it apart from others.\n\n\u2022 **Differentiate a project in title, description, and objective**: Use clear and concise language to describe the purpose and scope of your project. Avoid using generic terms or phrases that could apply to multiple projects.\n\n\u2022 **Best practices for making academically original work**: Conduct thorough research on existing projects and identify areas where you can improve upon or expand upon previous work. Be transparent about your methods and data sources, and avoid plagiarism.\n\n\u2022 **Technical + conceptual strategies to reduce similarity**: Consider using novel techniques or approaches that are not commonly used in similar projects. For example, you could explore the use of transfer learning or attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy of your machine learning models.\n\n\u2022 **Focus on unique problem domains**: Instead of focusing solely on a specific domain or industry, consider exploring multiple domains or industries simultaneously. This can help you identify common challenges and opportunities across different fields, and develop more generalizable solutions."
